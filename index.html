    <h1>Stage 0: Getting Started with HTML</h1>


<b>The World Wide Web</b>

<p>The <em>World Wide Web</em> is a collection of HTML documents.</p>

<p><em>HTML</em> stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML documents are the basis for everything on the Web.</p>

<p>Components of the web: (1) a <em>browser</em> = a program that runs on your computer to make requests to servers via the Internet using a protocol called HTTP and to display files found on the web; (2) the <em>Internet</em> = the world's largest computer network; (3) <em>servers</em> = computers optimized for hosting files that make up the web.</p>
<br>


<b>HTML</b>

<p>HTML is made up of text content (plain text that you see), markup (how the text is arranged), references to other documents (e.g., images and videos), and links to other pages.</p>
<br>


<b>Markup</b>

<p>Markup is made up of tags.</p>

<p>A <em>tag</em> contains an opening tag and, unless it is a void tag, it also contains a closing tag.</p>

<p>The contents within a tag could include other tags.</p>

<p>An <em>attribute</em> is a property of an HTML element.</p>

<p>An <em>HTML element</em> is everything within a set of opening and closing tags. HTML elements can be either inline or block. Block elements create an invisible box around the contents, and you can edit the dimensions of that box.</p>
<br>


<b>Computers are "Stupid"</b>

<p>Coding entails writing text in a language that a computer can understand.</p>

<p>Computers are sensitive to typos. Small mistakes that a "smart" human could easily correct can create huge problems when given to a "stupid" computer. Thus, programmers must write exactly the way a computer understands (with correct syntax).</p>
